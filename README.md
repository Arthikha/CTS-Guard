# ðŸ“Ž CTS-Guard

## Project Overview

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common repetitive strain injury caused by prolonged or improper wrist and finger movement, especially during tasks like typing.

This project aims to design a wearable system consisting of a **wristband and a ring like structure** to monitor hand and wrist activity patterns for early detection of CTS.  

The system uses **IMU sensors** on both the wrist and finger to detect:  

- Repetitive finger movements  
- Static or improper wrist angles  
- Prolonged usage patterns  

Additionally, the system may incorporate **hand PPG sensors (e.g., MAX30102)** to monitor circulation and complement movement data. An AI-based classifier can also be used later to analyze collected data to detect CTS risk.
