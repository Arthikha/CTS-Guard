# üìé CTS-prevention-device

## Project Overview

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common repetitive strain injury caused by prolonged or improper wrist and finger movement, especially during tasks like typing or using digital devices.  

This project aims to design a wearable system consisting of a **wristband and a ring** to monitor hand and wrist activity patterns for early detection and prevention of CTS.  

The system uses **IMU sensors** on both the wrist and finger to detect:  

- Repetitive finger movements  
- Static or improper wrist angles  
- Prolonged usage patterns  

Additionally, the system may incorporate **hand PPG sensors (e.g., MAX30102)** to monitor circulation and complement movement data. An AI-based classifier will later analyze collected data to detect CTS risk levels and notify the user. A mobile or web application will provide visualization and feedback.

## üß© System Components

### 1. Wristband Module
- **IMU Sensor**: Tracks wrist orientation & motion
- **ESP32 MCU/ ESP32-C3**: Processes data and handles BLE and WiFi communication
- **Vibration Motor**: Provides haptic feedback if posture is incorrect
- **401012 Li-Po Battery + Charger**: Portable power supply

### 2. Ring Module
- **IMU Sensor** (e.g., MPU6050 or MPU9250): Detects finger movement
- **Low-power MCU** (ESP32-C3 or nRF52832): Bluetooth communication
- **401012 LiPo Battery**: Lightweight and wearable

### 3. Communication
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** between ring and wristband
- Optionally sends data to external app via BLE/Wi-Fi

### 4. AI & Application
- Data collected and labeled for AI model training (classification of risky usage)
- Optional mobile/web dashboard for:
  - Live posture monitoring
  - Movement heatmaps
  - Alert history and feedback
